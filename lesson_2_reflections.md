# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This creates an empty repository with a .git/ directory. This lets Git know to start tracking changes.

# Commands So Far

$ git diff      # compare commits
$ git clone     # make a copy of a repository, including commit history
$ git checkout  # temporarily reset all files to a previous state
$ git log       # show the commit history
$ git init      # create new repo
$ git add       # add files to stage
