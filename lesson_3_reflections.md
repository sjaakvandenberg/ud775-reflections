# Lesson 3: Using GitHub to Collaborate
#
# In this lesson, you’ll get practice using GitHub or other remote
# repositories to share your changes with others and collaborate on
# multi-developer projects. You’ll learn how to make and review a pull
# request on GitHub. Finally, you’ll get practice by collaborating with
# other Udacity students to write a create-your-own-adventure story.
